## Exercises

The exercises in the unittesting folder are given by more senior front end developers that are part of the CodeJourneys community, where I forked this from. We often have sessions (like session one and two), where we will get assignments to complete and it is recommended for them to be completed using unit testing through Jest. The files then contain the examples we do together and the Other Exercises folder contains those that I did on my own.
